Common Policy Engine Implementation

Policies can be expressed in one of two forms: A list of lists, or a
string written in the new policy language.

In the list-of-lists representation, each check inside the innermost
list is combined as with an "and" conjunction--for that check to pass,
all the specified checks must pass.  These innermost lists are then
combined as with an "or" conjunction.  This is the original way of
expressing policies, but there now exists a new way: the policy
language.

In the policy language, each check is specified the same way as in the
list-of-lists representation: a simple "a:b" pair that is matched to
the correct code to perform that check.  However, conjunction
operators are available, allowing for more expressiveness in crafting
policies.

As an example, take the following rule, expressed in the list-of-lists
representation::

    [["role:admin"], ["project_id:%(project_id)s", "role:projectadmin"]]

In the policy language, this becomes::

    role:admin or (project_id:%(project_id)s and role:projectadmin)

The policy language also has the "not" operator, allowing a richer
policy rule::

    project_id:%(project_id)s and not role:dunce

It is possible to perform policy checks on the following user
attributes (obtained through the token): user_id, domain_id or
project_id::

    domain_id:<some_value>

Attributes sent along with API calls can be used by the policy engine
(on the right side of the expression), by using the following syntax::

    <some_value>:user.id

Contextual attributes of objects identified by their IDs are loaded
from the database. They are also available to the policy engine and
can be checked through the `target` keyword::

    <some_value>:target.role.name

All these attributes (related to users, API calls, and context) can be
checked against each other or against constants, be it literals (True,
<a_number>) or strings.

Finally, two special policy checks should be mentioned; the policy
check "@" will always accept an access, and the policy check "!" will
always reject an access.  (Note that if a rule is either the empty
list ("[]") or the empty string, this is equivalent to the "@" policy
check.)  Of these, the "!" policy check is probably the most useful,
as it allows particular rules to be explicitly disabled.
