    """Provides support for storing attachments to **Ming** MongoDB models.

    ``UploadedFileProperty`` can be used as a field type to store files
    into the model. The actual file itself will be uploaded to the
    default Storage, and only the :class:`depot.fields.upload.UploadedFile`
    information will be stored on the database.

    The ``UploadedFileProperty`` is UnitOfWork aware, so it will delete
    every uploaded file whenever unit of work is flushed and deletes a Document
    that stored files or changes the field of a document storing files. This is
    the reason you should never associate the same :class:`depot.fields.upload.UploadedFile`
    to two different ``UploadedFileProperty``, otherwise you might delete a file
    already used by another document. It is usually best to just set the ``file``
    or ``bytes`` as content of the column and let the ``UploadedFileProperty``
    create the :class:`depot.fields.upload.UploadedFile` by itself whenever it's content is set.

    .. warning::

        As the Ming UnitOfWork does not notify any event in case it gets cleared instead
        of being flushed all the files uploaded before clearing the unit of work will be
        already uploaded but won't have a document referencing them anymore, so DEPOT will
        be unable to delete them for you.
