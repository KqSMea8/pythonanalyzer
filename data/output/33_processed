    Tests UI jank on android devices.

    For this workload to work, ``recentfling.sh`` and ``defs.sh`` must be placed
    in ``~/.workload_automation/dependencies/recentfling/``. These can be found
    in the [AOSP Git repository](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras/+/master/tests/).

    To change the apps that are opened at the start of the workload you will need
    to modify the ``defs.sh`` file. You will need to add your app to ``dfltAppList``
    and then add a variable called ``{app_name}Activity`` with the name of the
    activity to launch (where ``{add_name}`` is the name you put into ``dfltAppList``).

    You can get a list of activities available on your device by running
    ``adb shell pm list packages -f``
